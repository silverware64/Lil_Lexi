# Lil Lexi

### Authors: Tobin Nickels and Nicholas Bell ###


Chapter 2 of the Design Patterns book presents a case study in the
design of a "What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get" (WYSIWYG) document
editor called Lexi. The goal of this assignment is to design and build a
subset of Lexi called Lil Lexi. Two students will work together on a
single submission. Each student should put their name in a comment for
every class that they implement.

This program of Lil Lexi is buggy, but works. Some things may cause the program to freeze or crash.

[^1]: This program of Lil Lexi is made for CSC 335 Object-Oriented Programming and Design.
